You have probably played the Tic-Tac-Toe game to pass time during school hours.
It’s fun when you play with paper and pencil. 
Here, we have developed a mini project in C Tic Tac Toe game – a simple console application without graphics.
While making a Tic Tac Toe game using C language, it is important to make use of arrays.
 The Xs and Os are kept in different arrays, and they are passed between several functions in the code to keep track of how the game goes.
 With the code here you can play the game choosing either X or O against the computer.

This Tic Tac Toe C game is such that you will have to input a numerical character, from 1 to 9, to select a position for X or O into the space you want. 
For example: if you are playing with O and you input 2, the O will go to first row – second column. 
If you want to place O in third row – first column, you have to enter 7. And, it is similar for the other positions.
